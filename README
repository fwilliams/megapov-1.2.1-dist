MegaPOV 1.2.1 for UNIX/Linux, binary linux version (povlinux.tgz) - README file

For the binary distribution for Linux/AMD64
===============================================================================

This is the README file for the compiled version of MegaPOV 1.2.1 for
Linux.  Platform specific instructions for POV-Ray can be found in
README.unix and in chapter 1 of the documentation.

This package contains a statically linked version of MegaPOV 1.2.1
compiled for the AMD64 platform.  It will run on both AMD CPUs supporting
these extensions (Athlon 64, Opteron etc.) and Intel CPUs with the compatible
EM64T extensions.  

Note in contrast to the x86 variant this version is built without SVGALib
display.

The install script can do both system wide installation (requires root 
privileges) as well as user level installation.  Installation as root is the 
recommended method.

MegPOV specific notes:
======================

MegaPOV is a collection of unofficial extensions for the freeware
raytracer POV-Ray.  It is maintained by a group of POV-Community
members - the MegaPOV Team.  Up-to-date versions and information can
be obtained at the MegaPOV website:

http://megapov.inetart.net/

This package contains all files that are necessary to run MegaPOV
in addition to the offical POV-Ray distribution.  If you do not
already have a version of POV-Ray installed you have to get one from
the POV-Ray website:

http://www.povray.org/

otherwise MegaPOV won't function correctly!

If you would like the MegaPOV Documentation in a different format than
it is supplied in this package you can obtain it separately in a
different form at the MegaPOV website.

All further information about using MegaPOV can be found in the
Documentation.

For the conditions for using POV-Ray and modified versions you should
have a look at the POV-Ray license (povlegal.doc) that is included in
this package.

This is a unofficial custom version of POV-Ray in terms of this document.
The POV-Ray Team is not responsible for supporting it.
