    Since years there was a polynomial solver builded in the <span class="trademark">POV-Ray</span>&#8482; sources. Unfortunately
    this tool was only for the intersection calculations in the raytracing engine. My idea was to
    create a gate between SDL and this existing solver.
  </p><p>
    All changes required for this feature are marked with <tt class="function">POLYNOMIAL_SOLVER_PATCH</tt>
  </p><p>
    The polynomial solver in SDL was designed only as a gate to an already implemented feature.
    It was used previously only for the intersection point. Every next intersection point is almost
    always different from the previous one because it is calculated with different polynomial
    equations. In the case of the polynomial solver accessed via SDL in its proposed form it is
    possible that it is called several times: first for the number of roots and next for each root.
    That's why before the access to old solver polynomials are cached now (only for SDL usage). This
    is done with the function <tt class="function">buffered_polynomial_solver()</tt> in the
    <tt class="filename">polysolv.cpp</tt> file. The whole change was splitted into three parts:
    </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>add two additional tokens to the parser (see <a href="parser.html#internals_tokens" title="5.3.1. Adding tokens">Section 5.3.1, &#8220;Adding tokens&#8221;</a>).</li><li>force parser to call <tt class="function">buffered_polynomial_solver()</tt> with
        the appropriate parameters from the script</li><li>force VM to call <tt class="function">buffered_polynomial_solver()</tt> with the
        appropriate parameters from the function engine</li></ul></div><p>
  </p><p>
    The complete operations within classic POV-Ray parser was placed inside 
    <tt class="function">Parse_Num_Factor()</tt> in <tt class="filename">express.cpp</tt>.
    The order of polynomial is read from the number of parameters there and then 
    <tt class="function">buffered_polynomial_solver()</tt> is called.
  </p><p>
    In case of VM in function engine this was a much more difficult operation.
    <tt class="function">n_roots</tt> and <tt class="function">nth_root</tt> have variable number of parameters.
    It is different than other functions works and it required new handling.
    First new entries were added at beginning of <tt class="function">POVFPU_Opcodes</tt>
    structure in <tt class="filename">fnpovfpu.cpp</tt>. Then a gate between parser and
    precompiled opcodes was introduced to <tt class="function">FNCode::compile_call</tt>
    in <tt class="filename">fncode.cpp</tt> with appropriate calls to dedicated compilers
    for new functions. Finally runtime code for new opcodes was added to
    <tt class="function">POVFPU_RunDefault</tt> in <tt class="filename">fnpovfpu.cpp</tt>.
